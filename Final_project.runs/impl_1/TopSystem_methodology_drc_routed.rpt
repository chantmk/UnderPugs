SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at image_handler/as/rgb3 of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.944 ns between image_handler/vga_sync_unit/v_count_reg_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and image_handler/rgb_reg_reg[7]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
